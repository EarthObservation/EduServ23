Prepared by:  
Krištof Oštir, Bujar Fetai, Matej Račič (University of Ljubljana)


## Theory

Slides for the theory part of the course are available here [Remote Sensing and Change Detection](./Theory/Slides.pdf).

## Preparation

The repository consists of two directories with the materials, installation instructions, theory and practical information.

* [Optical](Optical/README.md)
* [SAR](SAR/README.md)

The repository can be synchronized using `git pull` or downloaded as a zip file. The data used for the practical exercise can be downloaded from [geoclassroom](https://geoclassroom.fgg.uni-lj.si/course/view.php?id=13). 

Each practical has corresponding install instructions which should be completed in advance.
